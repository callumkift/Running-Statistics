Initial plan of script
----------------------

1) Check to see if there are any previous runs, i.e. is there a file with previous runs
		-	if there are previous runs, open file and add to the file
		-	if first run, then create new file and add run to it

2) User inputs:
		-	Date
		-	Distance
		-	Time
		-	Comment

3) Read data from file and organise into arrays, one for each of the inputs

4) Things that we would like to know:
		-	How your average speed varies over time
		-	See how the distances you run vary over time
		-	See your best average speed for certain distances, the one you just ran

5) These should be represented in a mixture of plots and text


Compare months
	Furthest ran in a month
	Longest duration ran in a month
	Best average pace in a month
	Most runs in a month
